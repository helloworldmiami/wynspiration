# Wynspiration

### Week 1 at Wyncode
#### Cohort 11

_Wynspiration_ is a simple one page project that automatically generates inspirational quotes from the `quotes.js` file located in `app/assets/javascripts/`.

## Contributing

Any current or former Wyncoder is welcome to contribute to the project, either by submitting quotes, or suggesting upgrades to improve the overall quality of the project.

_For New Features_ we recommend you open a new issue before creating a pull request so that your upgrades can be communicated beforehand.

_For New Quotes_ you can just add on to the `quotes.js` file and create a pull request so that your inspirational quote can be added to the project. You will also be added to the list of contributors, no matter how small or large your contribution. We ask that you avoid quotes that may negatively influence people's perception of Wyncode Academy and it's affiliates.
